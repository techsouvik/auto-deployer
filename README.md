## Introduction
Auto-Deployer is a system designed to automate the deployment of React applications directly from a GitHub repository. The system is composed of three services: the upload service, the build service, and the request handler service. These services communicate via a Redis queue.

## Features
- **Upload Service**: Downloads data from a given GitHub URL and uploads it to S3.
- **Build Service**: Builds the React code and uploads the build output to S3.
- **Request Handler Service**: Acts as a request handler to coordinate the deployment process.
- **Frontend**: A basic React frontend containing a simple form for user interaction.
